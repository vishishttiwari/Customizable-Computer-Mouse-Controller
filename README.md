# Customizable-Computer-Mouse-Controller
A hand glove for controlling the mouse pointer of the computer with gestures that can be customized by the user using a screen attached to the glove

omputer mouses have been in existence for a long time now, but they never seem to have really changed over the years. Therefore, we looked into making a new type of mouse that can create a whole new experience for computer users. We also aimed to create a mouse that uses most of the concepts covered in the ECE 5725 course, as well as operating via a Raspberry Pi. Finally, after seeing how simply using one's hand, rather than a mouse, is better suited for some computer applications, we decided to build a glove that acts as a computer mouse.
