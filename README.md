# Customizable Computer Mouse Controller
A hand glove for controlling the mouse pointer of the computer with gestures that can be customized by the user using a screen attached to the glove

Computer mouses have been in existence for a long time now, but they never seem to have really changed over the years. Therefore, I looked into making a new type of mouse that can create a whole new experience for computer users. I also aimed to create a mouse that uses most of the concepts covered in the ECE 5725 course, as well as operating via a Raspberry Pi. Finally, after seeing how simply using one's hand, rather than a mouse, is better suited for some computer applications, I decided to build a glove that acts as a computer mouse.


For my ECE 5725 final project, I created a Raspberry Pi-mounted glove that works as a computer mouse, thus naming it a Rat Glove. The Rat Glove has various capabilites, from simple mouse control to near-real-life usage of 3D software, which can be accessed via a user-inactive GUI program that is displayed on the piTFT screen. The GUI program displays five different applications: normal mouse control, puzzle solver, finger gesture customization, 3D software, and first-person shooter (FPS) game. Also, the mouse cursor on the computer screen receives its movement commands from the Rat Glove via Bluetooth. In addition, we implemented all of the main programs for this project in Python.
